  <h3>Impostor Syndrome - An Introduction</h3>

  <p>As 2017 winds down, I’m again imagining a better version of myself. The concept of constant self-improvement is something I truly believe in, yet the concept in and of itself is something I find difficult to improve on. I understand that to pursue something really worthwhile, it’s required that we struggle. Before I begin working towards my future goals, I find that it’s important to not just contemplate the past, but to look at yourself as you are <em>right now</em> at this moment. It’s not about regrets because what’s done is done. Instead, I find that it’s about making a choice, and that choice being, as so succinctly worded in <em>Shawshank Redemption</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Get busy living or get busy dying.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think life is a series of us making this choice. We don’t go straight one direction or the other, but rather some choices give us life while others are killing us. What I’m hoping and endeavoring towards is that the former far outweighs the latter.</p>

<p>Now, what does all this have to do with this blog and programming? Well, there’s something I struggle with from time to time, and I know I’m not alone in this. It’s <strong>Impostor Syndrome</strong>.</p>

<p>Do you ever find yourself asking questions like these?</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Why am I always on Google and Stack Overflow for help? Shouldn’t I just know the answers to these basic problems?</li>
    <li>I didn’t have the same formal education as my peers, so it makes sense that I’m less qualified.</li>
    <li>I have so many gaps in my education that I have no time to fill.</li>
    <li>I’m going to get exposed as unqualified once I submit this pull request.</li>
    <li>Is my text editor a stupid choice?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s funny is that I’ve already read other blogs on this topic, watched related TED Talks, and talked to other programmers who face the same issues, yet I still find myself in this hole. The actual <em>funny</em> part about this is that I’m the one digging this hole, no one else.</p>

<p>I do believe that in part it comes with the territory. The field of software development is demanding and not only requires a huge amount of programming knowledge and skills, but the ability to learn and grow along with the emerging technologies.</p>

<p>Thus, the purpose of this blog is namely to help me cope with my own imposter syndrome by putting my thoughts and emotions to words and looking at how silly and/or truthful my experiences are. If silly, great, I can just move on and spend no more time thinking on the issue. If truthful, then I can start developing a plan to counteract whatever I feel I’m lacking. Plus, it gives me an outlet to write about something non-technical but still related to the world of programming and software development.</p>
