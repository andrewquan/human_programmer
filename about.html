<h3>About this Blog</h3>
<p>
  My path towards becoming a Web Developer has been an uncomfortable one, but I don't believe I'm alone when it comes to this constant uneasiness. "Impostor Syndrome" is something I've dealt with as soon as I decided to drop my stable career in Project Management to go full-time developing web applications. Despite my efforts and relative professional success, the anxiety always seems to find its way back in one form or another.

<p>
  Truth is, this blog's purpose is to help me fight my own battle with Impostor Syndrome. Though, it's my hope that sharing my experiences, both past and present, can also provide encouragement to the weary Software Engineer as she battles her own feelings of doubt and apprehension. So please laugh, cry, and walk alongside me in this journey and maybe we can, for just a moment, remember that we're pretty awesome.

<p>
  Aside from Impostor Syndrome anecdotes, I'll also include a blog on technical topics, mostly as a way to learn new skills or develop ones that I'm uncomfortable with.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
  I'm a Web Developer from Los Angeles now living and working in Tokyo. I'm currently developing in Ruby on Rails and probably also dabbling in one of the new JavaScript frameworks. My current interests are volleyball, learning Japanese, health and fitness, and reading.
