<h3>About this Blog</h3>
<p>
  My path towards becoming a Web Developer has been an uncomfortable one, but I don't believe I'm alone when it comes to this constant uneasiness. "Impostor Syndrome" is something I've dealt with as soon as I decided to drop my stable career in Project Management to go full-time developing web applications.
</p>

<p>
  This blog's main purpose is to help me fight my own battle with Impostor Syndrome. However, the weary Software Engineer need not fight this battle alone and I hope others can find this blog beneficial. So please laugh, cry, and walk alongside me in this journey and maybe we can, for just a moment, remember that we're pretty awesome.
</p>

<p>
  Aside from Impostor Syndrome anecdotes, I'll also include a blog on technical topics, mostly as a way to learn new skills or develop ones that I'm uncomfortable with.
