Blogs are a great to learn a new skill because it reinforces your learning by *teaching*

One good method is to read other blogs and books, and then get to writing in your own style. Maybe your way expresses it in a new perspective.

The problem I sometimes face with this approach is that while researching the topic, I realize that I don't know all the concepts and such found in those blogs. Sometimes they appear in the code examples (and I get caught up trying to figure out what the example is doing and end up losing sight of the topic at hand), or they introduce another concept that may be helpful in your understanding of the current topic.

It's easy to feel insecure and get into an endless cycle of looking up another blog to figure out what the previous blog was talking about, and on and on.

It's important to finish topics. You can revisit those other topics later. Look at those as opportunities to write more blog posts.
