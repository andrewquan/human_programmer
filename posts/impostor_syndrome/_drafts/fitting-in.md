### Fitting In
#### {{ page.date }}

Pompadour hairdo. Fitted coat and shirt. Gym rat. Volleyball enthusiast. Closet *otaku*.

I was always taught that we all come in different shapes and sizes, and I understand the traditional idea of a computer programmer has changed quite a bit in [recent times](https://imgur.com/fDAoMw8), but I still occasionally find myself out of place with other developers.

I was recently at a coding meetup here in Tokyo and forced my way into a conversation about how there's a new [JavaScript framework]() seemingly every week. It was fun talking about the pros and cons of the popular frameworks, but I kept finding myself distracted by something completely unrelated. One of the programmers there had a really nice (and expensive) coat on, but he had left the brand tag on the sleeve. It was so taboo but I couldn't get myself to tell him so. Then I started noticing how others had their hair unkempt, or how their shirts were one or two sizes too large, or how much bigger I was physique-wise than the others (and I'm not a big dude). The list goes on.

I mentioned earlier that I had to *force* my way into the conversation. Everyone seemed to know each other though I doubt many of them did before the meetup began given that many participants were first-time attendees, much like myself. I'm an introvert by nature, but I actually find a lot of joy in intimate groups and meetups such as this, and it's usually relatively easy to start a conversation with someone. Why was it now that I had such a hard time with people who I thought were like-minded?

So I love having a sharp-looking hairdo, and a smart, well-fitted outfit on, especially when I'm going to be in a social environment. I take my health and fitness very seriously. I love being in the gym and feeling strong and healthy, plus there's the added benefit of *looking* healthy. I also put a great deal of effort over the years to be polished in my speech including making good (and not creepy) eye contact.

However, I've noticed lately that I take great care to balance that out a bit with looking *nerdy*. What I mean by this is, for example, having my laptop decked out in geeky stickers, or having my list of favorite animes and video games at the ready for the right time to name-drop.

I later found that many attendees were interested in the same things as I was. I was given new anime recommendations and even convinced a few people to give a new work out regimen a try.

I like the idea of being a ground-breaker of sorts. I know my [background]() as a web developer isn't conventional, which may be related to why I feel out of sorts in places such as coding meetups, but I'm really comfortable with who I am, and my personal appearance does give me confidence (which I definitely need help with!). I think there still is some negative connotations of what a software engineer is or should be, and I hope to be part of the wave that combats those ideas.
